The analysis was performed in R and involved the following skills and methods:
* Data cleaning
* Dimension reduction
* Proper handling of ordinal data
* Proper handling of a skewed dataset
* Multiple Factor Analysis
* Classification approaches (QDA, LDA, LogReg)
* Support Vector Machines (Linear, Polynomial, Radial)
* Trees (Boosting, Bagging, Random Forest)
